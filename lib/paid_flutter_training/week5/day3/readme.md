# 1. Handling Images in Flutter
Handling images in Flutter involves importing image files into your project's directory and then using the `Image` widget to display them in your app. You can load images from various sources such as assets, network URLs, or the device's file system. Additionally, you can use plugins like `cached_network_image` for efficient loading and caching of network images, or `flutter_svg` for displaying SVG images.
