# 1. Using Progress Bars flutter
Using progress bars in Flutter involves displaying visual indicators to show the progress of an ongoing task, such as loading data or completing an operation. You can use widgets like `LinearProgressIndicator` or `CircularProgressIndicator` to represent progress visually. These widgets can be customized with properties like `value`, `backgroundColor`, and `color` to match your app's design and provide feedback to the user about the status of the task.
